# Smart Irrigation V1.0
(English version - Versione in Italiano sotto)

I've been looking for weeks for a good and simple automation to water my plants on my terrace. I've been using a classic battery-powered irrigation control unit and it worked smoothly but it had two main downsides: 
1) It could not stop if it was raining (or if it rained the day before), so in rainy days water dripped from my terrace (and i was wasting liters of water for nothing);
2) It had limited possibilities in facts of programmability, but above all i had to run water for the same amount of minutes every day, independently from weather conditions.
I found some options but they were either too complex or too grass-oriented (i water my plants for about 1 to 3 minutes per day, while those programs suggested me to water for more than 10 minutes/day), so i developed myself a very simple and customizable automation in HomeAssistant.
